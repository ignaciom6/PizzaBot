# PizzaBot

This app has a `main.swift` class in which the user can write an input with this format `5x3(1,2)(2,3)` and the bot will find the route to each delivery point. This input is composed by the grid size (`5x3` in the example) and the coordinates `(1,2)(2,3)` to deliver the pizza. Once the user inputs the value, he will receive a result like this: `ENNDEND`, corresponding to the movements performed by the bot, where:

N = North, W = West, S = South, E = East, D = Drop Pizza

## Getting Started

Clone or download the project from the GIT repository and openÂ PizzaBot.xcodeproj.

In `main.swift` class, change `input` value in order to get the path printed on console.

The user will get an error in case the format is not correct or the coordinates are out of the grid bounds.

The user can also run the tests changing the target to PizzaBotTests and running it from `PizzaBotTests.swift` class.
